			<h2>NAVPERS</h2>
			<p>In 1998, the United States began uploading declassified documents to <a href="http://www.maritime.org/doc/" target="_blank">public domain websites</a>. The documents originated as scanned printable document files that were then transcribed into web text for global access. This domain was created as a new site for the digitization of naval documents. The first file that has been uploaded is a manual detailing the steps to conducting a naval shower.</p>
